Just got out of Havoc and wow, that   needs a cold shower and a glass of water. Like, it’s one of those things that leaves you feeling both exhilarated and kinda like you need a nap. Maybe it was the sticky theater floor or maybe it’s my damn inability to sit still for two hours, but, the whole thing was like a cinematic rollercoaster with an unpredictable puke factor.

I mean, the chaos, the endless fighting, Tom Hardy punching his way through the plot as if he forgot what a peaceful Tuesday looked like. It was like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a ballerina with an anger management problem. Yeah, sure, the storyline was there... buried under piles of debris and sweat. Or was it? Truth is, halfway through, I was questioning everything I knew about labyrinths and shady alleys. Like, is there a course on how to make a storyline that tangled?

And then! OH, the dizzying camera work, at moments, felt like it was trying to show off its best look, Mom, no stability! trick. Seriously, I need to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just to figure out what I missed during those what just happened? moments. Not sarcastic, just surviving.

> Ever get the feeling while 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 something that your brain is simultaneously fighting sleep and planning breakfast? That was about 3/4 of the way in when my attention span was in a war of its own against the caffeine crash.

Oh, and the sound. Explosions here, there, everywhere... and yet somehow the dialogue whispered like it had a secret to keep from me. Do sound mixers live in a mysterious realm where bullets purr softly so no one gets startled? Real questions, no answers.

Code snippet time, cuz why not. This has as much clarity as some plot points in Havoc: 
```c
int action(char scene) {
    scene = confusion;
    while (scene == chaos) {
        printf(Keep fighting!
);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Alright, almost forgot – Hardy’s performance. Brooding and brawling, with a sprinkle of emotional constipation that makes you wanna say, “Pass the metaphorical laxative, dude, and spill those feelings.” That said, it’s still a ride worth the ticket. And popcorn, obviously. Turn your brain to airplane 𝘮𝘰𝘥e and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   for the ride, not the logic.
